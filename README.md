<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Our group wants to make use of the Riot Games API to create a website that will come up with and host competitions for challenges that users will try to complete quickly by playing League of Legends. When users sign up for an account we will track their profile statistics to see who completes the challenges the fastest and the winners will earn exclusive badges and titles. This service targets players of League, Riot Games' competitive 5 v 5 MOBA and adds an extra layer of challenge to their standard gameplay that encourages them to try and be more active. Stat tracking websites already exist for these kinds of games but none of these websites have incentives for users to stay once they've finished doing an account lookup or finding rune pages.</p>
