<h2>A simple guide to using Rabbitmq Management</h2>
<h3>Access<h3>
<p>After successfully building and starting our docker containers, you must navigate to the localhost port assigned to RabbitMQ management, in this case it is http://localhost:15672 . Assuming your login isn't cached you should arrive at a login page with current credentials being test/test. in the overview screen you will see a graph mapping out queue activity over a recent time period, if there was any activity recently.</p>
<h3>Checking for queues<h3/>
<p> To check for a new queue or even see if queues are already being created, click the "Queues" option in the navigation bar at the top, and expand the all queues section, from here you should see a table labeled "overview" that shows the name, type, state, and message rates of any existing queues up to now, it is also easy to create a queue and designate which ports the queue should appear on. In our setup, we have a queue created by our backend as the container starts to ensure proper connection between the messaging service and the backend, this "hello world" queue should appear until we create a different queue or system for ensuring that access between these components in functional. </p>
